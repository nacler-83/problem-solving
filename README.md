# Unscramble Computer Science Problems Project

### Task0
**O(1)**
The functions in this file contain no loops. The first_text() function prints the first row within the dataset. The last_call() function prints the last row within the dataset. The operations executed will remain the same no matter the input.


### Task1
**O(n)**
There are 3 operations for each row within calls or texts input. The rest of the operations are roughly constant no matter the input. There are no nested loops within the code.


### Task2
**O(n)**
There are 5 operations for each row with calls input. The rest of the operations are roughly constant no matter the input. There are no nested loops within the code.


### Task3
**O(n long(n))**
While printing each area code in the local_call_percentage() function, we are also sorting which has a O(n long(n)) worst case time complexity.


### Task4
**O(n long(n))**
While printing the phone numbers in the find_telemarketers() function, we are also shorting which has a O(n long(n)) worst case time comple
